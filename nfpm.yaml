  liblogfaf (faf stands for fire-and-forget) is a dynamic library that is designed to be LD_PRELOAD-ed while starting a process that uses openlog() & syslog() functions to send syslog messages.
  It overrides logging functions to make log messages sent as UDP datagrams instead of getting written to /dev/log (which can block). This is useful for processes that call syslog() as part of their main execution flow and can therefore be easily broken when /dev/log buffer gets full, for example when the process that is expected to read from it (usually system syslog daemon like rsyslog or syslog-ng) stops doing that.
  A highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service
  discovery. etcd is inspired by zookeeper and doozer, with a focus on
